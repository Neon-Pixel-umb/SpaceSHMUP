# Space SHMUP

Welcome to **Space SHMUP**, a 2D space shooter game developed as part of a Unity project for the CS382 Game Design, Development, and Technology course. This game follows the classic SHMUP (shoot-'em-up) genre, where players control a spaceship and battle waves of enemies in space.

## Game Features

- **5 Enemy Waves**: Battle through five waves of enemies that will try to destroy your ship!
- **Damage Mechanics**: Enemies can damage the player's ship, adding to the challenge.
- **Fully Functional Shooting**: The player's spaceship can shoot to destroy incoming enemies.
- **Scrolling Starfield Background**: A dynamic starfield enhances the space atmosphere, immersing you in the void of outer space.

## Cool Enhancements

In addition to the basic mechanics, I made the game more energetic and engaging by adding **background music**. The music complements the gameplay and adds an exciting, lively atmosphere, making the space battle even more intense and fun.

## How to Play

1. **Move** your spaceship using the arrow keys or WASD.
2. **Shoot** by pressing the spacebar to destroy enemy ships.
3. **Survive** the waves of enemies while avoiding damage to your ship.
4. **Enjoy the music** as you fight your way through space!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpaceSHMUP.git
2. Open the project in Unity (developed using Unity 2021.3.33f1).
3. Play the game in the Unity editor or build it for your desired platform.
